- Significantly improves accuracy by 36% compared to current Microsoft Teams transcription  
- Creates consistent documentation that follows standardized formatting  

#### **Interview Summarization**
- Generates concise, context-aware summaries based on transcripts  
- Structures summaries according to DCR's preferred format for investigative documentation  
- Highlights key elements such as allegations, respondent statements, and supporting evidence  
- Easy ‘revision’ button to alter summary based on additional context or personal preferences  

#### **Interactive Chat Interface**
